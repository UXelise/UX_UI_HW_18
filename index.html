            <p>As a UX/UI designer, I look to design creative and simple solutions to complex problems.  UX/UI allows me to use my interdisciplinary background and interpersonal skills to empathize with user problems and find real solutions.  

                Who doesn’t want to make a positive impact?
                
                In December of 2020, I recieved my Bachelors of Fine Arts in Costume Design and Lighting Design from the Univeristy of Colorado Boulder.  Technical theatre has me the skills essential to working in fast paced collaborative enivornments.  As a designer, no matter the medium, I design with intention.
                
                Whether it’s a costume for the stage or a mobile app, the perspective of the user/audience is always at the center of my work. 
                
                Since 2016, I’ve worked primarily as a freelance theatre artist collaborating with local theatres to bring to fantastical characters and worlds to life.  Throughout the pandemic, I’ve worked with faculty and staff at the University of Colorado Boulder to advocate for and support student publishing initiatives.  I’ve also partnered with local nonproft, Creative Strategies for Change, to help provide anti-racism education and resourses to youth of color. </p>
